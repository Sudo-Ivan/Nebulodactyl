## Responsible disclosure

Nebulodactyl is a complex project that makes use of many components. We strive to keep everything as secure as possible and welcome you to audit the code yourself. We do ask that you be considerate of others using the software and **do not publicly disclose security issues before contacting us**.

Here's the deal: if you report an issue to us by email and we fail to respond within **one week**, you are welcome to publicly disclose what you found. This holds us to a standard of providing prompt attention to any issues that arise and keeping this community safe.

If you've found what you believe is a security issue, please email **[ivan@quad4.io](mailto:ivan@quad4.io)** and check [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md) for additional details.

> [!WARNING]
> Do not report security vulnerabilities through public channels or GitHub Issues.

## Getting started

Follow the [Local Development Guide](./DEV.md) to set up a working development environment. You'll need PHP `^8.4`, Node.js `>= 22.13`, and pnpm.

## Code style

We use [Biome](https://biomejs.dev) for linting and formatting frontend code, and [PHP CS Fixer](https://github.com/PHP-CS-Fixer/PHP-CS-Fixer) plus [PHPStan](https://phpstan.org) for the PHP codebase.

Run the checks before submitting your changes:

```bash
pnpm lint    # Biome: apply lint fixes
pnpm check   # Biome: verify formatting and linting
```

## Testing

All changes should keep the test suite passing:

```bash
pnpm test                 # PHPUnit
pnpm test:unit            # Unit suite
pnpm test:integration     # Integration suite
```

The CI pipeline runs the full test matrix against MySQL, MariaDB, and PostgreSQL on PHP 8.4 and 8.5. See [`.github/workflows/tests.yml`](./.github/workflows/tests.yml).
